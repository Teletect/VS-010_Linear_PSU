Linear Eurorack PSU + Mini Buss Board

*CAUTION* This project require you to work with mains voltages. If you are not confident in your abilities DO NOT PROCEED.
This is a linear PSU
I haven't spec'd a transformer for the BOM, you're on your own for that. a Dual secondary 12V, or center tapped will do. the regulators are 1.5A... you do the math ;)

This image is the protobuild. Don't follow this image as a guide. It is only here to show the form factor.
