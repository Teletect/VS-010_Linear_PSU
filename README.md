Linear Eurorack PSU + Mini Buss Board

*CAUTION* This project require you to work with mains voltages. If you are not confident in your abilities DO NOT PROCEED.

This is a linear PSU

I haven't spec'd a transformer for the BOM, you're on your own for that. a Dual secondary 12V, or center tapped will do. the regulators are 1.5A... you do the math ;) 
No heatsink spec'd, just use whatever. I made a footprint for a random ebay heatsink I found. Good luck on your search.
The terminal blocks with H / V are for video syncs, either to add them to the power buss, or to connect them to other buss boards.

*This image is the protobuild. Don't follow this image as a guide. It is only here to show the form factor.*
